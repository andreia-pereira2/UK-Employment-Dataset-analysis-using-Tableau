## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing job change trends in the UK using the **EMSI_JobChange_UK** dataset. By leveraging **Tableau**, I created interactive visualizations to highlight key insights related to industry and city-based job shifts. 

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Key Visualizations
I developed the following visualizations to improve data interpretation:
- **Horizontal Bar Chart**: Displays the **Top 10 Job Changes by Industry**.
- **Symbol Map Chart**: Highlights the **Average % Change by City**.
- **Tree Maps**: Show the **Top 10 Job Changes by Sub-Industry**.

## Insights & Analysis
- Analyzed data trends for **2014**, focusing on:
  - **Jobs per Industry**
  - **Top 5 Cities for Jobs**
- Identified significant industry shifts and regional job market variations.
